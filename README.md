This script is for spamming comments specified by you. One random comment under one video.

# Quick Start

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to this directory. Next, set up dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/sh4man4ik/CommentsSpammer.git
cd CommentsSpammer
npm install
```

3. You can add your comments to the `comments.txt` file. You can add as many as you like, but make sure to separate them
   with a **$** sign (as in the file).

4. Run the script.

```
node ./spammer.js
```

5. Once the browser and TikTok open, go to the **Feedback and help** page and log in to your account from there (red Log
   in button). This allows you to bypass TikTok's bot protection. After logging in, close the tab and **restart the
   script**.

6. After restarting, you will automatically log into your account, and the script will **start working**. One of the
   comments you specified in the comments.txt file will be **randomly left** under the video.
7. To stop the script, close the browser window or console. The script will also automatically stop working after 12
   hours.

# Important to know

- One comment is posted every **15 seconds**.
- Separate comments in the comments.txt file with a **$** sign (as in the file).
- While the script is running, do **not click on the open browser window**, as this will interrupt the script.
  Otherwise, you will need to restart it. It is better to simply minimize the browser window and console.
- Make sure that **TikTok is open in English** (the URL should be: https://www.tiktok.com/foryou?lang=en).
